This is an entry level program for Java Object Oriented Programming

The program simulates a banking mechanism like an ATM. 

Run AccountHolderTest.java: 

1. User will input their initial balance for his bank account. 
2. User will enter a deposit amount that adds to the account balance.
3. User will withdraw certain amount of money from the current account balance. If the remaining balance is below $50, the program will warn the user that they can not do that by displaying text as an inform. The program will continue to flag the user until the withdraw balance will not drive the remaining balance lower than $50. 
4.  The console will display the remaining balance with interest applied, the annual interest here is set as 4%.
